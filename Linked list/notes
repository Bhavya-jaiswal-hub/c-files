//  in the 32 - bit architecture the the pointer variable takes the 4 bit and in the 64 - bit architeucture the pointer variable takes 
  // the 8 bits to store the address 

//  How to convert the array to the linked list 

// Always the head of the linked list and rememner never ever tampered the head 
// Traversal in the linked list 

// Node x = Node(2,nullptr) --> this is just the object 

// Node y = &x; --> this is just to add the address of the x node in the y


// for making the combination of both of these things 
// Node* y =  new Node(2,nullptr)
